  <i class="fa-solid fa-money-bill"></i>
  <h3 class="smlabel">Limited Economic Opportunities</h3>
        <p>It is more difficult for refugee women to find good employment opportunities due to language barriers, unfamiliarity with the local job market, and likely a lack of relevant skills and training.</p>

        <h3 class="smlabel">Isolation and Social Disconnection</h3>
        <p>Refugee women are often isolated due to having to leave behind friends and other support systems. It is more difficult to rebuild relationships and establish a sense of community in their new environment.</p>

        <p>Gender inequality continues to be prevalent in many facets of life, 
          and for refugee women the gap is greater, limiting their ability to engage in entrepreneurial activities, due to a lack of knowledge of  certain market and resources necessary for success</p>

        <p>While trying to fit into a new culture, it is difficult to preserve cultural traditions and heritage. Many refugees face difficulty in passing down traditions and stories to future generations like culinary recipes.</p>

<div class="2-row-content">
  <h3 class="smlabel">Let's cook!</h3>
  <p>There is an opportunity to creating a positive impact for both refugees and the broader community by having a service run by refugees to fulfill a gap in the market that lacks a combination of authentic culinary experiences, inclusivity, and the growing appreciation for the stories and traditions behind the food.</p>
</div>
  <div class="2-row-content">
    <h3 class="smlabel">Why this industry specifically?</h3>
    <p>Many refugees possess unique culinary skills and traditional recipes from their home countries. Starting a food business allows them to leverage these skills while sharing their cultural heritage through cuisine to their local community.
