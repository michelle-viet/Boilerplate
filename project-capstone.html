While historically, the topic of the mental load has been very relevant to women, the app is framed in a gender-neutral light to adapt to evolving family dynamics as society continues to shift from tradition.</h2>

<div class="two-column-content-item">
  <h2 class="label-bold">Problem</h2>
  <p>The mental load is the often overlooked effort in daily domestic tasks, typically taken on by caregivers who handle more cognitive and emotional responsibilities than their partners. This can lead to overwhelm and exhaustion, leaving little room for self-care, as well as build resentment towards partners.</p>

  <p>An app designed to offer decision support, streamlined task management, integrated self-care reminders, and encourage productive communication between couples in order to share the mental load better.</p>

                      <p>
                        One of the most insightful lessons from this project was understanding the complexity of designing for a wide range of users, each with different needs and perspectives. Household management has traditionally been seen as a woman's role, but after surveying many queer couples, disabled couples, single households, other non-traditional family structures, and families with men who take on more household responsibilities, I knew it was essential to frame the app in a gender-neutral way. This required being intentional with language, rethinking features, and redesigning the overall user experience to avoid reinforcing outdated stereotypes and instead create an inclusive environment that resonates with users regardless of gender.</p>

                        Another key learning was navigating the challenge of designing for a topic as multifaceted and emotionally charged as the mental load. Managing household tasks involves many moving parts which can be a burden that can easily feel overwhelming. One of the biggest challenges was figuring out how to break this down in a way that felt manageable for users without oversimplifying the issue. I had to find ways to take complex, often invisible, mental processes and turn them into clear, actionable tasks within the app. The goal was to make the app intuitive and approachable without overwhelming users with too much information. This required not only understanding the psychological aspect of the mental load but also learning to design flows that guide users through these tasks seamlessly, helping them organize and offload their mental to-do lists without adding to their stress.</p>

                              <p>I‚Äôd like to explore how an app like this could be adapted for devices like smartwatches or other wearables, not only for maximum task tracking efficacy (which admittedly sounds a liiitle dystopian), but also to serve as a tool for encouraging healthier habits, such as break reminders and prompts for practicing mindful thinking</p>

                              <p>I‚Äôm definitely curious to see what could come out of this product if it were to be pushed further. I‚Äôd love to see if the app could foster lasting behavioural change such as how often users shift from needing prompts to anticipating tasks on their own as a means of measuring success.</p>

              <h3 class="smlabel-bold">A reminder that will not go away until you read the prompt out loud to make sure you actually read it</h3>
              <p>I found that I have the tendency to dismiss notifications (screen time reminders, event notifications, etc.) without really thinking about it. I‚Äôm sure users of MindSync may eventually find themselves putting off or glazing over reminder notifications if they get used to seeing them all the time. This feature gives the option of verbally reading out the task to close the modal, or to call 911 in case of an emergency if there is no time to do it- which must be annoying. Just like the mental load.</p>

      <h3 class="smlabel-bold">The help button that does not help</h3>
      <p>It‚Äôs easy to ask your wife or mom a billion questions about where the forks are, or what should the kids eat today. But it‚Äôs also easy to figure things out yourself (after a bit of digging around and thinkling of course). This feature will serve as a firm but helpful reminder of that maybe.. things can just be figured out along the way.</p>
